## Steps Performed
1. Configured the router and switch interfaces with the following IPs:
   - Router: 192.168.1.1
   - PC1: 192.168.1.2
   - PC2: 192.168.1.3
   - PC3: 192.168.1.4
   - PC4: 192.168.1.5
     
2. Verified connectivity by sending PDUs (ping) between devices.

## Files
- `basic_network_config.pkt`: Packet Tracer file with the topology.
